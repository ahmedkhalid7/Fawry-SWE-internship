Task: Create a banking application that allows customers to open a savings account, deposit
and withdraw money, and view their balance. The application should have the following
classes:

1. Account: A superclass that contains the account number, account holder name, and
balance fields. It should also have a constructor that initializes these fields, and methods
for depositing and withdrawing money.

2. SavingsAccount: A subclass of Account that includes an interest rate field and a method
for calculating interest on the balance.

3. Bank: A class that stores an array of Account objects and has methods for adding new
accounts, depositing and withdrawing money from accounts, and displaying the balance
of a specific account.

4. BankApplication: A class that contains the main method and allows customers to interact

with the banking application through a command line interface.
